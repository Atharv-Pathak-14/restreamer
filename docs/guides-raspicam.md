title: Raspicam
---

The Raspicam is the [video module for the Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module-v2/) devices.
We recommend that you use the latest [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) distribution
that has the video capture tools in `/opt/vc` pre-installed.

## Enable RaspiCam

Execute the `raspi-config` command and then select `Enable Camera`. Leave `raspi-config` and reboot your Raspberry Pi.

## Configure Restreamer

For Restreamer to be able to access the RaspiCam, you have to stop the Restreamer if it is currently running:

```sh
docker stop restreamer
docker rm restreamer
```

Restart the Restreamer with the environment variable `RS_MODE` set to `RASPICAM` and mounting the directory with the Raspberry Pi video capture
tools into the container (`/opt/vc`). Also you have to raise the privileges for the docker container in order to access the camera.

```sh 
docker run -d --restart always \
    --name restreamer \
    -e "RS_USERNAME=..." -e "RS_PASSWORD=..." -e "RS_MODE=RASPICAM" \
    -p 8080:8080 \
    -v /mnt/restreamer/db:/restreamer/db \
    -v /opt/vc:/opt/vc \
    --privileged \
    datarhei/restreamer-armv7l:latest
```

In order to stream what your RaspiCam is recording, you have to put `rtmp://127.0.0.1/live/raspicam.stream` into
the "RTMP/RTSP/HLS Video Source" field and press "Start". Keep in mind that you should set the video setting to `copy` because
the RTMP stream from the RaspiCam is already H.264 encoded.

## Environment Variables

These environment variables enable you to control the Raspberry Pi camera.

| Name | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `RS_RASPICAM_HFLIP` | `false` | Set to `true` to flip the video horizontally. |
| `RS_RASPICAM_VFLIP` | `false` | Set to `true` to flip the video vertically. |
| `RS_RASPICAM_INLINE` | `true` | Set to `true` to insert inline SPS and PPS headers on every I-Frame. This is recommended for HLS streaming. |
| `RS_RASPICAM_STABILIZATION` | `false` | Set to `true` to enable video stabilization. |
| `RS_RASPICAM_FPS` | `25` | Set the framerate. Possible values are between `2` and `30`. |
| `RS_RASPICAM_GOP` | `50` | Set the GOP size. Usually the framerate multiplied by 2 is a good value. |
| `RS_RASPICAM_BITRATE` | `5000000` | Bitrate of the video stream in bit/s. E.g. `5000000` is 5Mbit/s. For a high quality H264 stream with 1920x1080@30 a bitrate of 15Mbit/s would be suffucient. The maximum is `25000000` (25Mbit/s) |
| `RS_RASPICAM_H264PROFILE` | `high` | H264 profile. Possible values are `baseline`, `main`, or `high`. |

Change the defaults of these environment variable with care and make sure that you know what you are doing. Read more about the available camera
settings in the [Raspberry Pi camera documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/raspbian/applications/camera.md).

## Audio Support

Audio support is disabled by default, however an audio track with silence encoded as AAC will be added to the stream. Use the environment variables
`RS_RASPICAM_AUDIOBITRATE`, `RS_RASPICAM_AUDIOLAYOUT`, and `RS_RASPICAM_AUDIOSAMPLING` to modifiy the parameter of the audio stream. Values for `RS_RASPICAM_AUDIOLAYOUT`
are usually `mono` or `stereo`. There are [more known layouts](http://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-utils.html#channel-layout-syntax), but they are less common.

Audio is currently only supported on Linux Docker hosts that have the `/dev/snd` device available. In order to make the sound device
available inside of the docker container, you have to add it to the container and enable audio with `RS_RASPICAM_AUDIO=true`:

```sh
docker run -d --restart always \
    --name restreamer \
    -e "RS_USERNAME=..." -e "RS_PASSWORD=..." \
    -e "RS_MODE=RASPICAM" -e "RS_RASPICAM_AUDIO=true" \
    -p 8080:8080 \
    -v /mnt/restreamer/db:/restreamer/db \
    -v /opt/vc:/opt/vc \
    --device /dev/snd \
    --privileged \
    datarhei/restreamer:latest
```

The sound device is accessed with the ALSA drivers. Depending what system you have, there may be several audio devices available and you have to
pass the `RS_RASPICAM_AUDIODEVICE` with the correct value for your USB camera. To find the correct value, call (you need to have the `alsa-utils` installed):

```sh
arecord --list-devices
```

The output could be similar to this:

```
**** List of CAPTURE Hardware Devices ****
card 1: HD3000 [MicrosoftÂ® LifeCam HD-3000], device 0: USB Audio [USB Audio]
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
card 2: C170 [Webcam C170], device 0: USB Audio [USB Audio]
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
```

The value for `RS_RASPICAM_AUDIODEVICE` is the number after `card`. In this example it is `1` for the audio from the LifeCam. It is also possible that
there are several devices with the same `card` number. Then you also have to specify the `device` number in the value, separated with a `,` after
the card number, e.g. `1,0`.

For the audio environment variables `RS_RASPICAM_AUDIOCHANNELS` and `RS_RASPICAM_AUDIOSAMPLING` you need to know the capabilities of the device. You
can list those with the command:

```sh
arecord --dump-hw-params  --device hw:1,0
```

The output could be similar to this:

```
Recording WAVE 'stdin' : Unsigned 8 bit, Rate 8000 Hz, Mono
HW Params of device "hw:1,0":
--------------------

SUBFORMAT:  STD

FRAME_BITS: [8 16]

TICK_TIME: ALL
--------------------
arecord: set_params:1339: Sample format non available
Available formats:

```

The field `CHANNELS` tells you which channel setups are available (here `1`, i.e. mono) and `RATE` tells you in which range the value for `RS_RASPICAM_AUDIOSAMPLING`
can be (here between `8000` and `48000`).

```sh
docker run -d --restart always \
    --name restreamer \
    -e "RS_USERNAME=..." -e "RS_PASSWORD=..." \
    -e "RS_MODE=RASPICAM" -e "RS_RASPICAM_AUDIO=true" -e "RS_RASPICAM_AUDIODEVICE=1,0" \
    -p 8080:8080 \
    -v /mnt/restreamer/db:/restreamer/db \
    -v /opt/vc:/opt/vc \
    --device /dev/snd \
    --privileged \
    datarhei/restreamer:latest
```

In this example, the available sound devices are the microphones from USB cameras that are also connected to the Raspberry Pi. However, you can use
any USB device that declares itself as audio device to the ALSA drivers.

## raspi-config is missing

If you are running a Linux on your Raspberry Pi that is missing the `raspi-config` program, you have to install it first:

```sh
cd /tmp
sudo apt-get update && apt-get install -y alsa-utils
wget https://archive.raspberrypi.org/debian/pool/main/r/raspi-config/raspi-config_20180406+1_all.deb
sudo dpkg -i raspi-config_20180406+1_all.deb
```

Please check `https://archive.raspberrypi.org/debian/pool/main/r/raspi-config/` for the lastest available version of `raspi-config`.
